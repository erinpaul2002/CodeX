Create a coding editor with terminal to execute programs and see output. e.g. a min version of https://www.online-python.com/

Note: Only end to end finished and hosted functionality would be considered. Host your solution and provide URL for evaluation. No code samples would be accepted, only URL will be used for evaluation.

Eval criteria: Programs that can take input and display output. What unique features can u think of and add in your editor, service, thinking from user perspective and adding relevant feature. User is a young coder learning to code.

Tools usage: Use AI tools, code generation as much as possible. Cursor, Windsurf, CoPilot (anything). 

Please read assignment and instructions. Any submission that are just code or hosted links of existing tools send would be rejected immediately! We want to see what u can build!! Good luck, still time on your side.

Acceptable submission  - Input/Output works.
Good  submission -  Input/Output works in same terminal windows.
Great submission - Input with Text and GUI output works! 

Some Design hint - 
- Front end submit connect to backend that runs a code in a docker container. The input and output from/to docker image are reflected in frond end terminal.
- Use codemirror or monaco for code highlighting etc.
